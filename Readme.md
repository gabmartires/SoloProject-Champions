## Overview
This is my fourth Solo Project from Scrimba! The task was to create an endorsing app to improve morale at a company. The We Are The Champions App is intended to post comments. The adiitional goals include a to and from fields as well as a like button. The like button feature is supposed to be liked once per user. I tried but I just couldn't make it worked as Scrimbra required it.
